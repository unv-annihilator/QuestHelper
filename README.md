# QuestHelper

## What does it do?
7 Days to die modlet to install alongside [Darkness Falls](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/4941-darkness-falls-they-mostly-come-out-at-night/) that resolves a known server bug where all scout quests are generated from 0,0.

After installing this into the 'Mods' directory on both server and client the problem will be resolved and quests will generate near the user similar to single player.
